No lengthy readme. If you need any help, go to http://www.dukelupus.com - in there is a sbClient homepage with all the help on it. 

As a last resort, send me an e-mail to dukelupus@gmail.com - but beware, that is not my main account and I don't check it often. Please also give your version of sbClient, mIRC and Windows.
