No lengthy readme. If you need any help, go to http://www.dukelupus.com - in there is a sbClient homepage with all the help on it. 

As a last resort, send me an e-mail to dukelupus@gmail.com - but beware, that is not my main account and I don't check it often. Please also give your version of sbClient, mIRC and Windows.

Within the search results window there some keyboard shortcuts you can use:
You can request a file by pressing `r` or `ctrl-r` to request the file & remove from the results list.
  This will call the default autoget method set in options.
You can search within the results by pressing `ctrl-z` & entering a wildcard search pattern. (NB: ctrl-f wont work in a @custom window)
You can now send results to an internal queue to be downloaded.
